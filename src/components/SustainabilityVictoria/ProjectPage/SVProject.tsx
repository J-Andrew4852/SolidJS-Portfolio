                        <p>The final solution is the interactive Figma mockup that showcases all the pages of the mobile application. The mockup contains all the necessary functions that the user requires and has a fitting aesthetic theme to the design. Although while the mockup is expansive and covers every necessary page, it doesnâ€™t have the animations and micro-interactions that a high quality mockup should have.<br /><br />The app focuses on letting the user select the type of cuisine they would like to cook, then once they save recipes to their favourites the app will recommend what herbs and other plants show up often in those recipes. Through this the user is able to learn to cook new healthy meals while taking care of plants that they will eventually be using within their cooking.</p>

                        <p>After taking some classes at Curtin University for writing, I became somewhat of a creative writer myself and had the idea of BiblioFile. It was an ambitious project for the timeframe, especially with it being my first Full-stack website, but it is rewarding to see my idea become a working product. While I am satisfied with the functionality of the website, I would like to eventually rebuild the website with modern frameworks and less plugins. I believe that I would be able to rebuild the website and fix most if not all of the current issues with my current web development skills. Although if I were to go through the effort of rebuilding the website I would like to redesign it and look at the possibility of using AI image generators to create the images of the characters and their background.</p>
